A rocket thrown in space will keep traveling forever until some force acts on it like the thrusters or a planets gravity. A car in a road stops because of friction(road or brakes) or gravity at a hill. The second law states that the force on an object is equal to the mass of an object times the acceleration. The third law states that every force exerts an opposite equal force. If you punch a wall you exert a force on the wall and the wall exerts the same force on your fist. If you are standing the floor exerts a force to counter gravity.",

There is also a frictional force that exists because the ground is not smooth and has imperfections. The frictional force always acts in the opposite direction of the applied force. This is what makes moving furniture through the floor hard, because the floor has friction. If there were no friction like at an ice rink it would be much easier to move furniture.",

In this example two players are running toward each other in opposite directions and collide. The momentum of the linebacker is greater then the momentum of the fullback so the linebacker transfers his momentum to the fullback and that momentum cancels the fullbacks original momentum. Afterwards the players combine for a lower momentum.",

When the box is displaced from equillibrium(x=0) the spring will exert a force on the box. If the spring is compressed then the spring will push the box to the other direction until the spring is extended, then the spring will pull on the box until the spring is compressed and so on. The box will oscillate back and forth forever unless there is friction on the floor or energy is lost in the spring material.",

The force is equal to a number G multiplied by masss1 and mass2 of the objects and divided by the distance between the objects squared. This is the force that is exerted by the earth when you jump or fall from the sky. Any object with mass will exert this force. There is a gravitational force between two people in a train but because the mass of the two people is so small the effects of the force is bascially negligable. If the 2 people were in empty space eventually after a long time the force would join them like it does when you fall to the earth.",

If you take a pendulum and swing it back and forth you know that it will mantain that motion until it dies out. But if you attach another pendulum to that pendulum the system become chaotic and it is impossible to determine future motion. This is also know as the butterfly effect. It states that even a butterfly flapping its wings all the way across the globe can cause a chain reaction that causes a storm on the other side of the world.",

Now if you flip a coin and it lands on heads then when you flip the other coin it will always land on tails. This happens even if the two coins are separated by billions of light years. This property appears to break the crucial speed of light limit but causality is rescued by the fact that no information can be carried by this connection.",

If you dont observe the particles they will go through both slits at the same time like if the particle was a wave. Now you cant believe that the particle can go through both openings at the same time so you create a clone after it goes through the slits. Then you measure the clone to see which slit it went through but the universe somehow knows beforehand you will measure the clone so it makes the original particle act as if it was being observed and it goes through only one slit. Then if you add an erasor that erases the information of the clone before you can see it the original particle will act like it went through both openings as if the universe knew you would lose the information.",

One way to imagine it is if you are on a spaceship that moves faster than light then you could catch up to light that has already passed you. This means that you would be able to see light you already saw which means you would see events that already happened.",

          "content": "Space is made up of three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. Gravity is not really a force. Gravity is actually the bending of the fabric of spacetime. This bending is what makes objects attract like the earth and a person. Imagine you hold a blanket and place a bowling ball in the middle then you place some ball at a corner and it falls toward the center. The bending of the fabric is what makes the ball fall toward the bowling ball at the center. This is bascially what gravity is. The amount of curvature depends on the mass of the object.",

          "content": "Black holes are special objects predicted by einsteins equaitons of general relativity. These objects are so massive and heavy that they curve spacetime to a point where the bottom is an infinitesimal singularity. The bending of space is so great that no even light can escape the pull. If you pass the event horizon of a black hole there is no turning back you will fall and forever be trapped inside. Inside the black hole time becomes space and space becomes time.",

          "content": "Hawking radiation is the process of a black hole losing its energy. It is theorized that over time because of quantum events black holes emit radiation in the form of virtual particles. This causes the black holes to lose their mas and energy over time. This process is however incredibly slow and it would take a googol amount of years for a supermassive black hole to disintegrate. At the end of the universe black holes will be the last remaining objects for many many years.",
